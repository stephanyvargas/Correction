# Correction
Correction of the droop behavior on square pulses.

#reconstruction.py file
Aims to reconstruct pulses using real data from a High Voltage Board
 conected to a function generator (5us, 50 mV pulse)

#reconstruction_square_pulse.py file
Creates a square pulse that gets deformed by an arbitrary time constant tau.
The pulse is 1x1 (Amplitude x Time) in order to study the unitary case.
